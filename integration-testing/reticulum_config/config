# This is the default Reticulum config file.
# You should probably edit it to include any additional,
# interfaces and settings you might need.

# Only the most basic options are included in this default
# configuration. To see a more verbose, and much longer,
# configuration example, you can run the command:
# rnsd --exampleconfig


[reticulum]
  
  # If you enable Transport, your system will route traffic
  # for other peers, pass announces and serve path requests.
  # This should only be done for systems that are suited to
  # act as transport nodes, ie. if they are stationary and
  # always-on. This directive is optional and can be removed
  # for brevity.
  
  enable_transport = False
  
  
  # By default, the first program to launch the Reticulum
  # Network Stack will create a shared instance, that other
  # programs can communicate with. Only the shared instance
  # opens all the configured interfaces directly, and other
  # local programs communicate with the shared instance over
  # a local socket. This is completely transparent to the
  # user, and should generally be turned on. This directive
  # is optional and can be removed for brevity.
  
  share_instance = Yes
  
  
  # If you want to run multiple *different* shared instances
  # on the same system, you will need to specify different
  # shared instance ports for each. The defaults are given
  # below, and again, these options can be left out if you
  # don't need them.
  
  shared_instance_port = 37428
  instance_control_port = 37429
  
  
  # You can configure Reticulum to panic and forcibly close
  # if an unrecoverable interface error occurs, such as the
  # hardware device for an interface disappearing. This is
  # an optional directive, and can be left out for brevity.
  # This behaviour is disabled by default.
  
  panic_on_interface_error = No


[logging]
  # Valid log levels are 0 through 7:
  #   0: Log only critical information
  #   1: Log errors and lower log levels
  #   2: Log warnings and lower log levels
  #   3: Log notices and lower log levels
  #   4: Log info and lower (this is the default)
  #   5: Verbose logging
  #   6: Debug logging
  #   7: Extreme logging
  
  loglevel = 6


# The interfaces section defines the physical and virtual
# interfaces Reticulum will use to communicate on. This
# section will contain examples for a variety of interface
# types. You can modify these or use them as a basis for
# your own config, or simply remove the unused ones.

[interfaces]
  
  # This interface enables communication with other
  # link-local Reticulum nodes over UDP. It does not
  # need any functional IP infrastructure like routers
  # or DHCP servers, but will require that at least link-
  # local IPv6 is enabled in your operating system, which
  # should be enabled by default in almost any OS. See
  # the Reticulum Manual for more configuration options.
